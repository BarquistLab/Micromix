# Modifying Micromix

Depending on the way you have configured or downloaded Micromix, when making changes, the frontend or backend (or both) may require restarting before the changes are visible.

If using the preconfigured image, you can do this by pressing `Control + C` to stop the service in the relevant terminal.

```bash
# You can then re-run the required service

# To start the website
./run_website.sh

# To start the heatmap
./run_heatmap.sh

```

> *Note: <br>
> If you have precompiled yourself, you only need to press `Control + C` to stop the service in the relevant terminal, then press the up arrow to find the previous command, followed by `Enter`.*


## Preparing a new bacteria

Micromix can be used with any desired bacteria. Once a bacteria has been chosen, you will need to download and prepare some common files.
Here is a brief summary:

**Step 1:** Download files

**Step 2:** Create transcriptome

**Step 3:** Create eggNOG annotations

**Step 4:** Run script to generate .json files for Micromix

<br>

> In this example, we will use `Salmonella typhimurium SL1344`

<br>

### **Step 1:**

Download the genome (.fasta or .fa) and genome annotation (.gff or .gtf).

For this example, you can use the following:

```bash
# GFF
curl https://ftp.ensemblgenomes.ebi.ac.uk/pub/bacteria/release-56/gff3/bacteria_79_collection/salmonella_enterica_subsp_enterica_serovar_typhimurium_str_sl1344_gca_000210855/Salmonella_enterica_subsp_enterica_serovar_typhimurium_str_sl1344_gca_000210855.ASM21085v2.56.chromosome.Chromosome.gff3.gz -o salmonella_sl1344.gff3.gz

# Fasta
curl https://ftp.ensemblgenomes.ebi.ac.uk/pub/bacteria/release-56/fasta/bacteria_79_collection/salmonella_enterica_subsp_enterica_serovar_typhimurium_str_sl1344_gca_000210855/dna/Salmonella_enterica_subsp_enterica_serovar_typhimurium_str_sl1344_gca_000210855.ASM21085v2.dna.chromosome.Chromosome.fa.gz -o salmonella_sl1344.fa.gz

# Unzip
gunzip salmonella_sl1344.gff3.gz
gunzip salmonella_sl1344.fa.gz
```

### **Step 2:**

Generate a bacterial transcriptome. This is required to upload to [eggNOG-mapper](http://eggnog-mapper.embl.de/), which will provide annotations, including gene description, KEGG pathways, Gene Ontologies etc.

To get a summary of the features within your .gff file, you can run this command:

```bash
awk -F '\t' '{print $3}' salmonella_sl1344.gff3 | sort | uniq -c
```

This will display something similar to this:

```bash
awk -F '\t' '{print $3}' salmonella_sl1344.gff3 | sort | uniq -c
   4622 
    129 biological_region
   4466 CDS
      1 chromosome
   4636 exon
   4462 gene
   4462 mRNA
    113 ncRNA
    113 ncRNA_gene
     40 pseudogene
     40 pseudogenic_transcript
```

To generate the transcriptome, you need to decide which features to use. For example, we may only want to look at CDS regions, or we may want to look at a wider range of features as shown:

```bash
# The generate_transcriptome.py script is located here:
/scripts/generate_transcriptome.py

# To view the help menu
./generate_transcriptome.py -h

# If available, we recommend using a tag that exists for each loci such as a locus tag (sl1344_0001), 
# so un-named and hypothetical genes will be included. 
# You will need to manually open the .gff file to identify what fields are available (alternatives are gene_id, ID, Name etc).

# To run, select the feature (CDS etc), and also the gene ID type. 
./generate_transcriptome.py \
-fasta salmonella_sl1344.fa \
-gff salmonella_sl1344.gff3 \
-f ["gene", "ncRNA_gene", "pseudogene"] -a gene_id \
-o salmonella_sl1344_transcripts.fa
```

> Note: Bacterial genome annotations (.gff/.gtf) can be challenging to work with due to non-uniformity, duplicate gene names and many other issues. You may receive an error message saying that some genes are duplicated, and thus a transcriptome couldn't be created. If this happens, open the .gff file and manually change the locus_tags or gene identifier you have chosen. For example, if there are multiple SL1344_0010, change to SL1344_0010a and SL1344_0010b, then re-run.

### **Step 3:**

You can now upload your transcriptome to eggNOG by browsing to [eggNOG-mapper](http://eggnog-mapper.embl.de/) . Select **CDS** as shown, then upload your transcriptome **upload sequences**.
Enter your **email address** and **submit** the job. You will receive an email that you need to click on, which will take you back to their site where you can start your job **Start job**.

<img width="80%" src="images/eggnog_1.jpg" />

After a short time, you will receive another email providing a download link. This will take you back to their site where you can download the annotation files that will be used in the next step. **Please download as a .csv**

<img width="80%" src="images/eggnog_2.jpg" />


### **Step 4:**

The last step is extracting the required information from the eggNOG output and saving it to a compatible format for Micromix (.json files).

To do so, you will need to run the following:

```bash
# The script is located here 
/scripts/parse_eggnog_annotations.R

# R will need to be installed on your machine for this to execute successfully, type the following to make sure (you should receive a version number
R --version

# If you have trouble installing R and BiocManager on Ubuntu
# Try this link: https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-r-on-ubuntu-20-04/

# When running, you need to provide the eggNOG annotation file as shown
# The resulting output files will be saved in the current directory
Rscript parse_eggnog_annotations.R eggnog_annotations.csv

# After running, you should the following two new files will be created:
gene_annotations.json
pathways.json

# Gene annotations requires a quick tidy up (removing redundant /'s)
sed -i 's/\\//g' gene_annotations.json

```

> The script `parse_eggnog_annotations.R` can be modified to extract and link additional functional annotations, currently it only extracts GO and KEGG IDs linking pathway names with these IDs. If required, you will need to find an R package or API that can provide the description of the interested IDs. 

<br>

## How to add a new organism

If you are adding a new organism, you will need to add a new entry to `datasets.json`. 

If you are modifying an existing bacteria/organism, there should already be an entry, which requires no action. However, in any case you will need to link the new organism to the expression data - see the next section.

```bash
Micromix/Website/frontend/src/assets/json/organisms.json
```

Here as an example where we have added **Bacteria B**:

```json
{
  "items": {

    "Bacteria A": {
      "name": "Bacteria A",
      "description": "Manually select datasets.",
      "path": "/bacteriaA",
      "id": "bacteria-a-e2ad6b25-40cb-4594-8685-f4fcb3ceb0e7",
      "datasets": ["Bacteria A RNA-seq"]
    },
    "Bacteria B": {
      "name": "Bacteria B",
      "description": "Manually select datasets.",
      "path": "/BacteriaB",
      "id": "bacteria-b-e2ad6b25-40cb-4594-8685-f4fcb3ceb0e8",
      "datasets": ["Bacteria B RNA-seq"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Description of the tags:

**"name":** - The name of the bacteria (displayed on button).

**"description":** - The description (displayed on button).

**"path":** - This path automatically points to `Micromix/Website/frontend/src/assets/organisms/`. This is where the majority of configuration files are stored for each bacteria within the site. For each new bacteria that is added, you should browse to this location and copy either the default folder or an existing bacterial folder and rename with your new bacterial name. In this example, the entire default folder should be copied and re-named to BacteriaB. Within this newly renamed folder is an icon you can choose to update, which is displayed on the button. You can also edit the file `filters.json` to add/modify/create custom filters (discussed below in more detail in the section [Modifying or adding gene or pathway annotations](modifying_micromix.md#modifying-or-adding-gene-or-pathway-annotations).

**"id":** - A hex number that must be unique for each bacteria.

**"datasets":** - Should link to an entry in this file: `Micromix/Website/frontend/src/assets/json/datasets.json` (see below). 

> After adding new organism, you will need to link it to the  expression data - see the next section

<br>

## How to add new expression data

Although the heading mentions expression data, data from other next generation sequencing (NGS) approaches can be used. For example, proteomics data, genome data etc.

Once the expression (or relevant) files have been generated, they should be saved here:

```bash
Micromix/Website/backend/static/
```

The corresponding file should then be added as an entry to `datasets.json`.

```bash
Micromix/Website/frontend/src/assets/json/datasets.json
```

Each new entry requires all the fields presented here, such as **text**, **value** and **separator**. The new dataset can be added to an existing entry or be added as a completely new entry. Here the new dataset, called **New dataset**, is added to an existing entry ("Bacteria A RNA-seq") and is linked to the file **new_data.tsv**. 

```json
{
  "Bacteria A RNA-seq": {
    "label": "Bacteria A RNA-seq",
    "options": [
      {
        "text": "Dataset 1",
        "value": {"filename": "dataset1.tsv", 
                  "separator": "\t", 
                  "decimal_character": ".", 
                  "columns": [{"value": null, "text": "All columns"}, "Sequence name", "locus tag", "Name", "Start", "End", "Strand", "Condition 1 logFC", "Condition 2 logFC"]},
        "separator": "\t"
      },
      {
        "text": "New dataset",
        "value": {"filename": "new_data.tsv", 
                  "separator": "\t", 
                  "decimal_character": ".", 
                  "columns": [{"value": null, "text": "All columns"}, "Sequence name", "locus tag", "Name" "Start", "End", "Strand", "Condition 1 logFC"], 
                  "pre_selected_columns": ["locus tag", "Name", "Condition 1 logFC"]},
        "separator": "\t"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
If the dataset is not linked to an existing entry, e.g. data from a new study. One needs to add the name of the dataset to the organism.json file of the organism of interest (see previous steps). Here **DNA sequencing data** represents the added dataset.
```json
 "Bacteria A": {
      "name": "Bacteria A",
      "description": "Manually select datasets.",
      "path": "/bacteriaA",
      "id": "bacteria-a-e2ad6b25-40cb-4594-8685-f4fcb3ceb0e7",
      "datasets": ["Bacteria A RNA-seq", "DNA sequencing data"]
```
Here is a brief description of the file contents:

**"Bacteria A RNA-seq":** - The is the bold value that cannot be selected in the dropdown menu when selecting a new dataset

<img width="50%" src="images/select_data_dropdown_bold.png" />

**"text": "Dataset 1"** and **"text": "New dataset"** - These are the names that will appear in the dropdown box that when selected will load the corresponding expression data

**"value":** - this contains the filename with the expression data, the delimiter and decimal character. 

The **columns** field should contain all columns within the associated file. If the column names do not match, an error will occur.

> *Note: <br>
> If you would not like to immediately show all columns, you can decide which columns should initially be displayed with **pre_selected_columns**. They can be re-added by the user when selecting the data and selecting **choose additional columns...**.*

<img width="50%" src="images/choose_additional_columns.png" />

> After adding new expression data, both the frontend and backend will require a restart.

<br>

## Modifying or adding gene or pathway annotations

There can be up to four files that may need to be edited, depending on requirements.

```bash
# Files associated with gene annotations and pathways

# Frontend - bacteria specific
frontend/src/assets/organisms/<bacteria>/pathways.json
frontend/src/assets/organisms/<bacteria>/filters.json

# Frontend
frontend/src/components/search_query.vue

# Backend
backend/static/gene_annotations.json
```

This image represents the general structure how filters are linked to a pathway and that pathway contains genes that can be searched for. The site allows any type of pathway or functional annotation to be added, as long as it can follow this structure.

<img width="85%" src="images/filters_pathways_genes.png" />


### Gene annotations

Each gene should have a unique identifier, as seen below with BT_0001, BT0002 etc. Depending on the functional annotations that have been extracted, they will be linked and displayed in this file: `gene_annotations.json`. If additional functional annotations are required, they can be added to the script in the previous section (above), or if specific classifications or categories are required, they can be added manually.

> *Note: <br>
> If you have more then one organism loaded in the site, all genes should be present in this file. You will need to manually add the contents from both organisms `gene_annotations.json` into a single file. No additional code specifying which organism the ID links to is needed. The site looks in this file and searches through all IDs independently to which organism is selected.*

An example of `gene_annotations.json`

```json
{
    "BT_0001": {
        "go_id": [
            "GO:0003872",
            "GO:0005524"
        ],
        "kegg_pathway_id": [
            "bth00010"
        ]
    },
    "BT_0002": {
        "go_id": [
            "GO:0004148",
            "GO:0045454",
            "GO:0050660"
        ],
        "kegg_pathway_id": [
            "bth00010",
            "bth00020",
            "bth00260"
        ]
    }
}
```
> If you have multiple organisms/strains that are to be loaded in the site, you will need to have all gene IDs in this file. Currently, you will manually need to do this by copying the output from `gene_annotations.json` from each organism and making a single file that the site can use. 

### Pathway annotations

All pathway annotations should be linked to each organism/bacteria and their specific genes. For this reason, the underlying pathways are stored within each bacteria's folder. For example:
```bash
# Bacteria A
Website/frontend/src/assets/organisms/bacteriaA/pathways.json

# Baceria B
Website/frontend/src/assets/organisms/bacteriaB/pathways.json
```

Ideally, these files are automatically generated from a script, as they can be quite large and detailed. If they have been automatically generated, you can add/replace the existing file. Otherwise, specific entries can be added or modified as required.    

A snippet of `pathways.json`, showing the first two GO and KEGG entries
```json
{
    "go": [
        {
            "id": "GO:0003674",
            "name": "molecular_function (GO:0003674)"
        },
        {
            "id": "GO:0005575",
            "name": "cellular_component (GO:0005575)"
        }
        ],
    "kegg": [
        {
            "id": "bth00010",
            "name": "Glycolysis / Gluconeogenesis (bth00010)"
        },
        {
            "id": "bth00020",
            "name": "Citrate cycle (TCA cycle) (bth00020)"
        }
        ]
    }
```

### Linking functional annotations to the site

Finally, to link the annotations so they can be loaded on the site and filtered, two files need to modified.

```bash
# 1) The filters for each bacteria
# Bacteria A
Website/frontend/src/assets/organisms/bacteriaA/filters.json

# Bacteria B
Website/frontend/src/assets/organisms/bacteriaB/filters.json

# 2) Loading the filters
Website/frontend/src/components/search_query.vue
```

**1) Filters for each bacteria:**

Each bacteria is required to have its unique set of filters. This can be a direct copy across multiple bacteria, but separate files are required. Within `filters.json`, you can setup and modify all available filters.  

**2) Loading the filters:**

The last setup is linking all the existing information we have created/modified in the above steps into the site. This file is stored here: `Website/frontend/src/components/search_query.vue`

```bash
# Loading functional annotations is achieved from the function
load_autocomplete_json()
# This should be lines 335-348 (shown below)
```

```javascript
load_autocomplete_json() {
    this.filters.items.functional["Filter by annotation"]["GO Term"].items.filter_annotation.source.items = this.pathways.go;
    this.filters.items.functional["Filter by annotation"]["KEGG Pathway"].items.filter_annotation.source.items = this.pathways.kegg;
},
```
Each element specificaly refers to particular files and filters.

**this.filters.items.functional** 

The data from only one bacteria can be displayed on the site at once - therefore, the site will load the filters for that organism/bacteria after it has been selected - this part of the code points to the active organism/bacteria and does not need changing.

**["Filter by annotation"]** 

This is the overarching/parent filter name that all functional annotations are stored under in the file `Website/frontend/src/assets/organisms/bacteriaA/filters.json`

For example, in the below snippet, all filters are stored under **functional** then **Filter by annotation**, then each different functional annotation is declared, here this starts with  **"GO Terms"**:

```json
 "functional": {
      "Filter by annotation": {
        "GO Terms": {
          "properties": {
            "type": "filter",
            "query": "annotation_code",
            "code_type": "go_id"
          },
          "items": {
            "filter_annotation": {
	    }
	}}}}
```



**["GO Term"].items.filter_annotation.source.items**

**"GO Term"** will be the name displayed in the dropdown box on the site. The remaining part of the code loads the filter's default values that are contained within `filters.json`.

<img width="20%" src="images/filter_by_annotation.png" />

**= this.pathways.go;**

Links to the `pathways.json` file and searches for all the entries under the parent term **go**. The names here need to match exactly. This tells the site to load all the GO entries and make them available for searching when **GO Terms** is selected in the dropdown menu. Likewise for other pathways of interest, you will need to add additional lines in to `search_query.vue` and link to the correct sections of the corresponding elements of the linked files.

> *Note: <br>
> If you have added additional functional annotations, or if you would like to add/remove current annotations from the dropdown menus - you can do this within `search_query.vue`. There are comments provided in the <dropdown> tags in the first 200 lines of code to make this process straightforward - a basic knowledge of Javascript is required.*

<br>

## Adding new visualisation plugins


Plugin buttons can be programmed to load specific visualisations, or link to other webpages, such as genome browser tracks as applied in the Micromix server housing Bacteroides data, [here](http://micromix.helmholtz-hiri.de/bacteroides/).
    
The default approach for a visualisation plugin is to pass the expression values to an API which returns the desired visualisation and is displayed within the site. 

The plugin configuration file is stored here: `Micromix/Website/plugins.json`
    
```json
{
    "plugins": [
        {
            "_id": "khds8fohoduskfi7syf99",
            "desc": "2D and 3D heatmap",
            "image_url": "https://github.com/BarquistLab/Micromix/frontend/src/assets/heatmap_hiri_logo.svg",
            "name": "Heatmap"
        },
	{
            "_id": "5f984ac1b478a2c8653ed827",
            "desc": "Clustered heatmap by the Ma'ayan Laboratory (Max 200 genes per query)",
            "image_url": "https://github.com/BarquistLab/Micromix/backend/plugins/clustergrammer.svg",
            "name": "Clustergrammer"
        },
	{
            "_id": "khds8fohoduskfi7syf91",
            "desc": "Click to open new tab containing genome tracks",
            "image_url": "https://github.com/BarquistLab/Micromix/frontend/src/assets/jbrowse.png",
            "name": "JBrowse"
        }

    ]
}
```
    
### Each plugin requires four fields:
	
 - **_id** -  This is the unique identifier for the plugin - it be should be assigned a unique HEX number.
	
 - **desc**  - The description written below the bold text on the button.

 - **image_url** - URL to the button image.

 - **name** - The name in bold on the button.

> Each plugin also requires a python script to pass the expression data to the API. These files are stored here: `Micromix/Website/backend/plugins`. If you would like to create your own, there is a file called `template.py` that you can modify for your own purposes.
    



## Database maintenance

Micromix stores session data within MongoDB. Over time, the database will grow and may require that old entries are removed. In the `\scripts` folder, there are three python scripts that allow you perform general maintenance - these can be run from the command line.

`MONGO_count_records_between_dates.py` to count the records between dates

`MONGO_look_for_locked.py` to look for locked session IDs. This may be useful for integrating into a Cron job or similar if wanting to automate removal of records, but exclude locked sessions

`MONGO_remove_records_between_dates.py` To remove records within a specified timeframe – you also have the option of manually inputting session IDs to be excluded, such as IDs that are linked to collaborators or IDs that might be linked to a publication

You can also interact with MongoDB from the command line. For example:

```bash
# To list the available databases
mongo --eval "printjson(db.adminCommand('listDatabases'))"

# To give details about the database 'micromix'
mongo micromix --eval "var stats = db.stats(1024 * 1024); printjson({dataSizeMB: stats.dataSize, storageSizeMB: stats.storageSize, totalEntries: stats.objects})"

# To get the head of a record
mongo micromix --eval "printjson(db.visualizations.findOne())" | head

```
